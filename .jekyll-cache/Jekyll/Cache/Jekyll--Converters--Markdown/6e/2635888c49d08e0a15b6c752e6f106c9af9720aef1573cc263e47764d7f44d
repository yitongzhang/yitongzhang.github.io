I"|<p>It’s been… uh nine months since the last update on this site’s open redesign progress, and I’ve finally gotten around to some some bug fixes<!--more--></p>

<p>Can you believe this site didn’t work on mobile this entire time? I mean, I started the design with almost no layout, relying mostly on basic typography to create hierachy, so I thought the mobile would be usable enough I could come back and update it later. Turns out, I forgot to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> because who knew jekyll would initialize the boiler without? Anyway, that’s fixed.</p>

<p>The other embarassing that I forgot is to set up analytics. Turns out, only the events fired from my hidden archival site were making it through to Google Analytics. That’s fixed too.</p>

<p>Lastly, I cleaned up the date formatting on this site so that it’s always: date + month spelled out + last two letters of year (e.g. 03 mar 21), which I like for being unambiguous for non-US readers. You can also drop the date and it’s still readable.</p>

<p>One cool thing about re-using a font you’ve already purchased is that you can have a font that you like, for free! Yay! That’s probably the only cool thing, because it’s all downhill from here. While Colfax slightly furistic yet friendly geometry served me well on the <a href="http://flowchart.design/">Autoflow marketing page</a>, it’s becoming increasingly clear that it’s not really made for text-heavy sites.</p>

  <li>The jump between regular and medium is pretty aggresive</li>
