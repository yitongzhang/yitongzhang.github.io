I"ß<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Yitong, a designer in San Francisco. I grew up in Montreal, Canada â€“ a very cold place my family moved to when I was young. Immigration is a big part of my story. You can listen to me talk about it on <a href="https://designdetails.fm/episodes/1xROYMXj">Design Details</a>.</p>

<p>I currently work on design systems at Coinbase. I also designed a bunch of the consumer app (the blue one that most people use).</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like making things.</p>
