I"‡	<p>Over the past few years, thereâ€™s been an under-discussed, but highly consequential shift in the compositon of the SF tech fauna.<!--more--></p>

<p>In the 2010s, the late stage tech boom of the 2010s attracted lots of big tech workers and IPO goldrush chasers to the city. Many lived in isolation tanks in SOMA, working at late stage startups in search of that elusive IPO. Others lived in the Mission, busing down to South Bay to work at big tech for that juicy total comp. There were others, but those two genus probably described 70% of the techies in the city.</p>

<p>With the advent of remote work, a lot of those types have left for places with a higher quality of life per dollar. For the same cost of living, you could be in Brooklyn! And if you didnâ€™t care about culture, you could quasi-double your savings rate by moving to Austin or Seattle (but really Bellevue lol).</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve been reading the deluge of articles about the SF AI boom, it may seem like weâ€™re about to enter another cycle like the last one. But the reality on the ground is quite the opposite. The field is so young there are no at scale AI companies hiring buckets of senior software engineers (yet).</p>

<p>Anecdotally, it does seem like more and more people are moving here because of AI, but itâ€™s not nearly at the same scale as we saw during the ZIRP-y hiring frenzy of the 2010s. Most of the newcomers Iâ€™ve met are entrepreneurs, explorers, or weirdos who are here to be among like-minded people, in spite of the doom-loop narratives and poor quality of life per dollar.</p>

<p>Overall, there are far fewer techies here than before, but the one who are here seem like they are full of energy and exitement. As a result, the techie relationship to the city has changed too  where many techies of the last era viewed themselves as gentrifiers / interlopers and wrestled with the guilt of their existence in this city, this era of techies love the city, feel like they belong, and want to hold their elected officials to account.</p>

<p>To me, this is the most bullish Iâ€™ve ever been about SF. The food still sucks, but being here is counter-cultural again. Choosing to live here causes your friends to raise their eyebrows now in the same way I imagine moving to Silicon Valley in the 80s did.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve made SF weird again, and thatâ€™s a good thing.</p>
