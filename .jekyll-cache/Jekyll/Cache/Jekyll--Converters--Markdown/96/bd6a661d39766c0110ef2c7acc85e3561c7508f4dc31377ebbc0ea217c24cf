I"°	<p>I havenâ€™t update my personal website since late 2017Â â€“ probably the longest period ever between two redesigns. Itâ€™s held up well for over 4 years, but itâ€™s time for a refresh.<!--more--> I have several motivations for this latest effort. First, Iâ€™m writing more so Iâ€™d like a blog-first design, something that can be a permanent home for my thoughts on the internet for decades to come. Second, Iâ€™m itching to write more code lately, and Jekyll is a pretty low friction way of getting back into. Lastly, Iâ€™ve been toying around with the idea of building a Notion-driven Jekyll competitor, so I figured that before embarking on that, Iâ€™d make at least a serious attempt at building something on Jekyll to see where it performs well and where it falls short.</p>

<p>Something else that Iâ€™d like to experiment with is designing this site directly in code. Iâ€™ve done this on some smaller projects before, but never tried it on anything of this level, so it should be fun. I have a general idea of where Iâ€™d like to go with the design, but am planning on figuring most of it out as I go. As a result, I expect this site to be pretty janky while it is under construction.</p>

<p>First up, getting rid of <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a> in order to roll my own theme. Things are gonna look pretty barebones to start with, but Iâ€™m exciting to get something out there. After a few hours of noodling around, I got myself set up with a pretty basic site from scratch â€“ itâ€™s barely designed at all, but at least the typography no longer hurts my eyes. I went with Colfax and a bit of IBM Plex, the former because it was a typeface I had already paid for, and the latter for dates and, at least aspirationally, code snippets. Iâ€™d like to buy something more fun from <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/">Future Fonts</a> later, but Iâ€™ve got to figure out the baseline for the rest of the site because letting myself fall down the type rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I really appreciate foundries like <a href="https://processtypefoundry.com/help/base/how-many-domains-can-use-the-fonts/">Process</a> that issue licenses allowing for usage on multiple domains. Itâ€™s nice to have a small roster of fonts that can be easily used on small projects. Typekit used to serve this purpose for me, but Iâ€™ve grown to hate the subscription fee lately. Iâ€™d much rather pay the maker of the product directly and own the license.</p>
