I"ı'<p>San Francisco is a place that defies legibility. It‚Äôs hard, yet very fun to love ‚Äì and definitely not for everyone.<!--more--> It‚Äôs the postcard city with the bridge, the piers, and the museums, but it‚Äôs also the shit-stained hell hole much decried on Twitter, and also the has-been tech hub so often lamented in ‚ÄúGoodbye SF‚Äù medium posts from tech guys who lived in SOMA for three years, yet somehow also the bastion of radical social progressivism.</p>

<p>All of these faces of SF exist as someone‚Äôs truth, but they‚Äôre not mine. They‚Äôre not the reason I fell in love with the place many years ago, and certainly not the cause for my continuously renewed passion. To me ‚Äì SF has always been about a kind of low key, unabashed passion for niches, a place where people are deeply and weirdly interested in things for no other motivation than the joy of being interested. It‚Äôs the quiet, intense, and sometimes awkward passion rolling off from people sitting at a cafe on their laptop reading papers on days so nice it should be illegal to be anywhere but outside.</p>

<p>And the more it deviates from that ‚Äì which it can‚Äôt help but do every decade like clockwork ‚Äì the worse it gets. In meme format, it goes something like this:</p>

<p>So this is my attempt to show you the parts of SF that compell me. I‚Äôll walk through what I think are the best parts of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù SF, then get into some really niche stuff. This is by no means an easy guide to follow. In fact, it would probably take several months. It‚Äôs what makes SF illegible. But if you‚Äôre the kind of person I‚Äôm writing for, and you make an effort to experience SF like this, I think you will love it as much as I do.</p>

<h2 id="enjoying-sf-with-your-body">Enjoying SF with your body</h2>
<p>Though SF has a tendency to attract people who live like they‚Äôre brains in a vat, it is not without its charm! If you‚Äôre here for the first time, take your body outside!</p>

<p><strong>Doing stuff</strong></p>

<p>So let‚Äôs start niche: there are some very pretty <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2020/5/19/21264034/best-urban-stairs-steps-sf-san-francisco">stairs</a> and slides. If this is your kind of thing, you can make a whole day out of hunting for these steps. For most people though, I‚Äôd recommend bookmarking these on your map and checking them out when you‚Äôre nearby</p>

<p>Then there are the parks: Land‚Äôs end is my top pick if you don‚Äôt have a lot of time. You can also pair it with a trip to the Legion of Honor ‚Äì a smaller Fine Art mueseum that is just the right size to be interesting, but not so big that it‚Äôs a chore. Presidio is huge and a little hard to experience as a tourist, but if you have to pick one spot, Lover‚Äôs Lane is gorgeous. Golden gate park is really nice and pairs easily with a trip to De Young museum</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre staying at a place with a kitchen, you should shop at a local grocery like Rainbow / Birite /Berkeley Bowl / Gus‚Äôs, and cook yourself a meal. California produce is out of this world ‚Äì especially in the summer! Lower commitment version of this is picking something up from Birite, and going for a picnic at Dolores Park.</p>

<p>In the evenings, it‚Äôs fun to move your body a bit. Mission Fusion is a great spot for some very SF kind of dancing ‚Äì it‚Äôs loosey goosey, and each dancer will tend to bring a little of their own background and experience into it ‚Äì so every dance is a little bit of an improvisation. The church in which the dances are usually held is also really cool! If a little bit more structure is your thing, head to the Church of 8 wheels. It‚Äôs a roller skating rink‚Ä¶ also in a church! Something about SF makes people want to do silly things with their bodies in churches.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoorsy / sporty things</strong></p>

<p>There‚Äôs a type of ‚ÄúSF guy‚Äù (gender neutral) you‚Äôll often hear about who‚Äôs into climbing and endurance sport. If you‚Äôre here, try to be that person for a bit ‚Äì this city is made for runs, rides, swims, and climbs!</p>

<p>Most accessible among all of these is likely Midnight Runners. Available in many cities of course, but the SF one has a lot of people, and they typically go hit up a bar afterwards to hang too, providing a great chance to meet people. One step up (haha) from running is climbing. Yosemite being the birthplace of climbing, SF is naturally full of climbing gyms. If you‚Äôre visiting the Presidio, would recommend going to Movement for the views. Otherwise, a morning climb + lunch in the mission is always a great way to start the day too.</p>

<p>Though more effortful, my favorite way to see the sights around here is through a bike ride in Marin: yes, it‚Äôs streanuous and you‚Äôll likely need to be here for longer than a week to justify this, but the ride up Mt Tam, or the seven sisters, or down to Stinson Beach is just ineffably beautiful!</p>

<p>Equally effortful and fun is open Water swimming in Aquatic Park / Berkeley Pier. Swimming here is a great cultural contrast to SoCal. The water is cold, the beaches suck, and it‚Äôs often gloomy ‚Äì¬†but the whole thing is surprisingly popular with NorCal people. It‚Äôs intense, but also very meditative. Forces you to be present and focused on your body!</p>

<p><strong>Pastries</strong></p>

<p>As someone who grew up in Montreal, I feel like I have a reasonably high bar for pastries. San Francisco probably has one of the highest concentrations of excellent pastry shops per square mile outside of Paris. Almost every neighbourhood has a world class patisserie, with some like the mission boasting up to 4-5! Some favorites below:</p>

<p>Maison Nico: a recent favorite for me. Incredibly luxurious pastries paired with some of the most delicately beautiful French aspic gel√©s, tartines, and other savoury goods. They‚Äôre quite under-reported by the local food media for how amazing they are, but I think that‚Äôs changing now.</p>

<p>Tartine: Perhaps a classic at this point, and well deserved! To me, they have deeply American take to viennoserie in the best possible way. Everything is big, bold, crispy, flavourful ‚Äì yet somehow still refined!</p>

<p>Arsicault: probably top croissant in the city for me, best enjoyed with a coffee, after bike ride up Hawk Hill. To me, Arsicault is the opposite of Tartine. Where the former is bold and rustique, Arsicault is more refined and classic.</p>

<p>Arizmendi ‚Äì¬†more homey, but still fun because they‚Äôre a coop, which imo is a very SF thing.</p>

<p>Breadbelly and Jina Bakes are both incredible Asian flavoured French-style bakeries. Breadbelly has a super good kaya bun (rare to find kaya anything in SF!). Jina has a collab with Daeho for a galbijim croissant.</p>

<p>Craftman &amp; Wolves ‚Äì a little pretentious, but they kinda deserve it. Muffin thing with egg inside is incredibe. Particularly delightful to me that it comes with a tiny bit of salt and pickles.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee</strong></p>

<p>I won‚Äôt get into this too much, since the guides are quite good. My only tip is to avoid blue bottle and Philz even though they started here because they‚Äôre ubiquitous now. For local chains, try Sightglass and Equator instead. For small shops, go to: Saint Frank, Four barrel, Wrecking Ball, Coffee Movement, Sextant, Ritual, Linea, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese food</strong></p>

<p>Honestly, the chinese food in SF is not that good compared to NYC and LA, which is sad. South and East bay have all the best spots. Especially overrated spots that I would avoid: Mission Chinese, China Live, literally all the dimsum spots in the city (except Dragon Beaux, Palette Teahouse and Koi Palace), San Tung, and most of the old school spots that usually pop up in guides. Don‚Äôt trust reviews when it comes to Chinese in the Bay Area, not on Yelp, not on Eater. I feel like the reviewers feel some kind of cultural obligation to put some of the old school joints in the list, despite them not being that good.</p>

<p>If you must eat Chinese: Yuanbao jiaozi, Z&amp;Y, and Mr. Jiu‚Äôs are great. In a pinch, I will cook you some good Chinese food if you‚Äôre craving it.</p>

<p><strong>East Bay and Marin</strong></p>

<p>Some East Bay favorites: Wojia, Good to eat dumpling, East Ocean HK seafood restaurant, Mam Hanoi, Laotian place in Alameda, Soba Ichi, Fourn√©e, Flowerland, Tokyo fish market, Berkeley horticultural nursery, Thai Temple on Sunday, Bake sum, Sunday bake shop, ordinarie wine, La guerrera‚Äôs kitchen. Berkeley bowl (my goodness!), nyum bai, Church of mushroom</p>

<p>Marin: Rent a bike, go across the bridge to sausalito. Take the ferry back. Hiking in Marin: Mt Tam, Muir Woods, Steep Ravine trail. Mill Valley is also super cute small town. China camp very nice too</p>

<h2 id="as-for-the-spirit">As for the spirit‚Ä¶</h2>

<p><strong>The social scene</strong></p>

<p>Do not be conned into ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù in SF. The night life here is not good compared to LA and NYC. Everything closes at 9. Most of the most interesting social events are house parties and oh boy does the house party scene go deep and weird.</p>

<p><strong>Checking out ‚ÄúTechnology‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs Silicon Valley, everyone wants to check out the technology right? Typically people will go visit Google and Facebook campus and go have lunch there. You won‚Äôt be able to tell . You won‚Äôt see either the practice or the spirit of technology there ‚Äì only the wealth and benefits. Instead, I would recommend:</p>

<p>Checking out the Internet Archive: the people who run archive.org operate out of an old church in Richmond. It‚Äôs weird, and wonderful, and and deeply unique.</p>

<p>Go to a demo night: as of this writing there seems to be multiple demo events per week thanks to the generative AI wave.</p>
