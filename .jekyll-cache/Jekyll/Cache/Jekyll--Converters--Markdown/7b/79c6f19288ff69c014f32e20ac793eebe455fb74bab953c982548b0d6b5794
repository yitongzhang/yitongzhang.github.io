<p>As an avid Arc user and design enjoyooor â€“ the implications of where theyâ€™re heading with this latest announcement makes me quite uneasy.

<p>Right now, Arc is a venture-funded browser with superior UX but no clear business model, hoping to find a non-ad based business before they run out of funding. At least thatâ€™s what it seems like from the consistent criticism of Googleâ€™s business model in their public communication.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIeJF3kL5ng&amp;t=771s">this feature</a> (gorgeous video btw), Arc now has a variable cost to pay to their LLM provider of choice on every search. With API costs coming down, Iâ€™m sure they can front this for users for a long time.</p>

<p>But now theyâ€™ve gone from a high fixed but zero marginal cost business to a negative unit economics business. (You could argue that technically unit economics are always negative to to server infra costs, but this takes them further down that path).</p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™ll take years, but negative unit economics will come collecting one day: you can only defy the laws of market physics for so long.</p>

<p>By demonstrating enough adoption, they can likely stave off profitability for long enough to grow to a size where they can genuinely threaten Chrome. And maybe on the way, a new business model for software that owns demand (users) and can commoditize suppliers (websites) emerges.</p>

<p>But if it doesnâ€™t they will inevitably need to fall back on the tried-and-true aggregator model of auctioning off their usersâ€™ attention. Maybe at first, it comes in the form of an innocuous affiliate fee they can take on commerce driven by their recommendation.</p>

<p>But a few tough quarter, maybe another rate hike cycle, where cash becomes king again â€“ itâ€™d be hard to resist the temptation of ranking results by fee and auctioning placementâ€¦</p>

<p>To be clear â€“ I donâ€™t think that ads are fundamentally bad and user hostile. Maybe a modern small business has been built on the back of ads. And I do believe that the browser company has their heart in the right place and can likely create a much more user-aligned ad model while also delivering a next generation browser with incredible UX.</p>

<p>I love their mission and want them to win â€“ we all love a David and Goliath story after all. Just find the implication that theyâ€™re not gonna have the same incentives and business challenges as Chrome a bit hard to believe. Would much rather they be honest about it.</p>
