<h2 id="fixing-some-long-overdue-issues">Fixing some long overdue issues</h2>
<p>Can you believe this site didnâ€™t work on mobile this entire time? I mean, I started the design with almost no layout, relying mostly on basic typography to create hierachy, so I thought the mobile would be usable enough I could come back and update it later. Turns out, I forgot to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> because who knew jekyll would initialize the boiler without? Anyway, thatâ€™s fixed.</p>

<p>The other embarassing that I forgot to set up analytics.</p>

<p>Lastly, I finally cleaned up the date formatting on this site.</p>
